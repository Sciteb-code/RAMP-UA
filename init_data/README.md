# Data to initialise the microsim

Before running the model in earnest, we need to estimate coefficients on the disease model. The data in this directory are used to do that. Once the coefficients have been calculated it does not need to be run again.

The [microsim_initialisation.py](../microsim/microsim_initialisation.py ) file actually runs the initialisation routines.

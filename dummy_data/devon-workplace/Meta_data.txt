The data is stored by home MSOAs. The columns are:

"PID"
Peronal ID. "PID" is the index between this probability dataset and other individual-level data for micro-simulation modelling.

"HOME_MSOA"  
Code of the home MSOA.

"WORKPLACE_MSOA"
Code of the destination MSOA of workplace. This dataset records the top 30 most likely destinations for each individual. So the data for each individual is split in 30 rows.

"WORKPLACE_MSOA Probability"
Probabilitiy of choosing the correspondent workplace MSOA.

"Driving Probability"
Probability of driving to work.

"Bus Probability"
Probability of taking bus to work.

"Train Probability"
Probability of taking train to work.

"Cycle Probability"
Probability of cycling to work.

"Walk Probability"
Probability of walking to work.

Note that the individual's mode-choice probability is independent from the workplace probability. To compute the eventual travel mode use probabilities, the user should time the corresponding workplace probability.

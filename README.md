# RAMP-UA

This is the code repository for the RAMP Urban Analytics project.

The microsimulation model that ties the different components together is in the [microsim](./microsim) folder.

For more details, see the full project repository on OSF.IO: https://osf.io/qzw6f/ (currently this is private, sorry, while we work out which data sources can be shared and which can't be, but the whole project will become public asap).

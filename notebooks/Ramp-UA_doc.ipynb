    "This microsimulation models aims to simulate the spread of a pathogen through a population, taking into account where people live and the places they visit (e.g. retail, work, school). In this version of the model, we simulate COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 transmission in England, but the model could be repurposed for other infectious diseases and/or geographical areas. Potential uses for the model include simulating the effect of starting and stopping different interventions (e.g. school closures) and predicting the impact of asmptomatic transmission.\n",

    "SPENSER (Synthetic Population Estimation and Scenario Projection Model) is used to create population estimates at the household level for England (https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research-projects/spenser-synthetic-population-estimation-and-scenario-projection-model/\n",
    "). In other words, it generates a set of representative individuals (with a given age, sex and ethnicity) assigned to households. A household is one ore more individuals assumed to be living in the same 'home' (a physical space such as a house or flat).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Health status\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals are given one of four possible health/disease states:\n",
    " - 0: Susceptible -- never had disease or no longer immune.\n",
    " - 1: Exposed (pre-symptomatic) -- individual has been infected and can infect others, but not (yet) showing symptoms.\n",
    " - 2: Exposed (symptomatic) -- individual has been infected, can infect others, and is showing symptoms.\n",
    " - 3: Recovered -- individual has immunity.\n",
    " - 4: Died -- indivdual has died.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals are assigned a job ('work', high level category for now), a primary or secondary school and/or shopping behaviour ('retail'). Other activities will be added in future iterations as required. Each of these activities is assigned a duration (fraction of day the individual spends doing this) and one or more possible locations (e.g. individual has 1 office but may visit multiple shops). A 'flow' variable gives the probability of an individual going to each location (fractions which sum to 1 per activity). E.g. if there are three local shops that an individual is most likely to visit, each will have a 'probability' of ~0.33.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Travel mode and time \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 'Danger' scores\n",
    "\n",
    "When 'infectious' individuals visit locations, they increase the 'danger' score for that location. This translates into an increased likelihood ('risk') that another 'susceptible' individual travelling to the same location will become 'exposed'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The danger score assigned to each location is calculated as\n",

    "\n",
    "Danger_multiplier and risk_multiplier are user-defined weights (default set to 1). With these default weights, then if an infected individual spends all of their time in one location, they will give that location a 'danger' of 1.0. If another individual spends all of their time in that location, they will receive a 'risk' of 1.0."

The component `activity_location` points to a number of different [**`ActivityLocation`**](./microsim/activity_location.py) objects. These hold information about the locations of different activities (mainly an identifier, flows and danger score).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the initial `Microsim` object is created, it can then be updated through a series of steps (days). At each step, the danger scores assigned to all venues are updated based on how many infectious individuals have visited. Next, each individual gets an updated risk based on where they have been, and their disease status is updated accordingly."

    "This microsimulation models how a pathogen spreads through a population, taking into account where people live and the places they visit (e.g. retail, work, school). In this version of the model, we simulate COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 transmission in England, but the model could be repurposed for other infectious diseases and/or geographical areas. Potential uses for the model include simulating the effect of starting and stopping different interventions (e.g. school closures) and predicting the impact of asmptomatic transmission.\n",

Each of these activities is assigned a duration (fraction of day the individual spends doing this) and one or more possible locations (e.g. individual has 1 office but may visit multiple shops). A 'flow' variable gives the probability of an individual going to each location (fractions which sum to 1 per activity).\n",

The component activity_location points to an <b>ActivityLocation</b> object which holds information about the locations (mainly an identifier, flows and danger score). The ActivityLocation object references to an other class, <b>ColumnNames</b>, to ensure consistent column names.\n",

At each step, the danger scores assigned to all venues are updated based on how many infectious individuals have visited.
